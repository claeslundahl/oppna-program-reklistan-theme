// We all know that, no matter how hard we may try, sometimes we do need to
// use quick fixes, hacks and questionable techniques in our code.
// It happens, whether we like to admit it or not. Whilst this isn’t ideal,
// we have to do it from time to time; all of us.
//
// The real problem, though, is that we rarely go back and tidy these
// things up. They slip through the cracks, get ignored, go unnoticed,
// and stay for good. This we do not have to do.
//
// What is needed is a way of allowing these hacks when necessary,
// but making sure that they don’t go unnoticed and unresolved.
// Enter shame.css.
